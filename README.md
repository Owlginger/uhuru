## Uhuru REST Framework

A tool to easily integrate your front-end to your back-end RESTful resources.

Uhuru is a tool with a small foot-print that will help you manage your web application development. If your development cycle involves Frontend frameworks or libraries making RESTful API calls to a server running Java or PHP, then this tool is for you.

Note: The bones for this project are currenlty being discussed and developed. We should make a full public release soon.
